## Variables
Variables are like containers that hold data in a computer program. They give names to data so that we can use and manipulate them easily. In programming, variables have a specific data type that defines the kind of data they can hold, such as numbers, characters, or more complex structures.
## if-else Statements
if-else statements are used to make decisions in your program. They allow the program to perform different actions based on certain conditions. The program checks if a condition is true, and if it is, it executes the code inside the if block. Otherwise, it can execute the code inside the else block.
## While Loops
While loops are used to repeat a set of instructions as long as a certain condition remains true. The loop will keep running the code inside it until the condition becomes false. This allows you to automate repetitive tasks.

These are fundamental concepts in programming that enable you to control the flow of your program and manipulate data effectively. Understanding variables, if-else statements, and while loops is essential for creating functional and dynamic programs.
