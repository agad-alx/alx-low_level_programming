# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation
Bit manipulation in C involves working with individual bits within a data type. This can be useful for various tasks like setting or clearing specific bits, checking the value of a bit, or performing bitwise operations. Common data types for bit manipulation include integers and sometimes characters.

Here are some common bit manipulation operations in C:

1. Setting a Bit:
   To set a particular bit in an integer (or any integral type), you can use the bitwise OR (`|`) operator with a bitmask. For example, to set the 3rd bit (indexing from 0) of an integer `x`:

   ```c
   x |= (1 << 3);
   ```

2. Clearing a Bit:
   To clear a specific bit, you can use the bitwise AND (`&`) operator with a bitmask where the bit to clear is set to 0, and all other bits are set to 1. For example, to clear the 2nd bit of an integer `y`:

   ```c
   y &= ~(1 << 2);
   ```

3. Toggling a Bit:
   To toggle (invert) a specific bit, you can use the bitwise XOR (`^`) operator with a bitmask. For example, to toggle the 4th bit of an integer `z`:

   ```c
   z ^= (1 << 4);
   ```

4. Checking the Value of a Bit:
   You can check if a particular bit is set or cleared using the bitwise AND (`&`) operator. For example, to check if the 1st bit of an integer `a` is set:

   ```c
   if (a & (1 << 1)) {
       // Bit is set
   } else {
       // Bit is cleared
   }
   ```

5. Bitwise Shift:
   You can perform left (`<<`) or right (`>>`) bitwise shifts to move bits within an integer. This is often used to extract or insert specific bit patterns.

   ```c
   // Left shift to multiply by 2
   int result = x << 1;

   // Right shift to divide by 2
   int result = y >> 1;
   ```

6. Bitwise Operators:
   Bitwise operators like `&`, `|`, and `^` can be used to perform operations on individual bits between two integers. For example, bitwise AND can be used to extract common bits between two numbers.

   ```c
   int commonBits = a & b;
   ```

Remember that the behavior of these operations may vary depending on the platform's architecture and the size of data types. Be cautious when dealing with signed integers and consider using unsigned integers when working with individual bits to avoid issues with sign extension.

7. **Bit Counting**:
   You can count the number of set bits (1s) in an integer using various algorithms, such as Brian Kernighan's algorithm or lookup tables. Here's an example using Kernighan's algorithm:

   ```c
   int countSetBits(int n) {
       int count = 0;
       while (n) {
           n &= (n - 1);
           count++;
       }
       return count;
   }
   ```

8. **Bit Masks**:
   Bit masks are often used to extract or manipulate specific sets of bits within an integer. You can create custom masks to isolate and work with specific bit patterns.

   ```c
   // Extracting the lower 4 bits of an integer
   int lower4Bits = x & 0x0F;
   ```

9. **Bit Fields**:
   In C, you can define structures with bit fields to specify the number of bits each field should occupy. This is useful for memory-efficient storage of data with specific bit-length requirements.

   ```c
   struct Flags {
       unsigned int flag1 : 1;
       unsigned int flag2 : 1;
       // ...
   };
   ```

10. **Bitwise Rotation**:
    You can perform bitwise rotation to shift bits in a circular manner, either left or right. This can be useful in certain algorithms and cryptography.

    ```c
    // Left rotate 'x' by 'n' bits
    int leftRotate(int x, int n) {
        return (x << n) | (x >> (sizeof(int) * 8 - n));
    }
    ```

11. **Bitwise Constants**:
    You can create constants with specific bit patterns using bitwise operations, which is often seen in low-level programming for hardware control or setting configuration flags.

    ```c
    // Create a constant with the 5th bit set
    #define BIT_5_SET (1 << 5)
    ```

12. **Endianness**:
    Bit manipulation can be crucial when dealing with endianness issues, where you need to convert between big-endian and little-endian representations of data.

    ```c
    // Convert from little-endian to big-endian (assuming 32-bit integers)
    uint32_t littleEndian = 0x12345678;
    uint32_t bigEndian = ((littleEndian & 0xFF) << 24) |
                         ((littleEndian & 0xFF00) << 8) |
                         ((littleEndian & 0xFF0000) >> 8) |
                         ((littleEndian >> 24) & 0xFF);
    ```

These advanced techniques can be applied in various scenarios, including embedded systems programming, low-level hardware interfacing, cryptography, and network protocols. Understanding bit manipulation is essential for efficient and precise control over binary data.

13. **Bit-Scan Operations**:
    Bit-scan operations involve finding the position (index) of the first set (1) or unset (0) bit in an integer. These operations can be essential in certain algorithms and data structures.

    - To find the position of the first set bit (least significant bit):

    ```c
    int findFirstSetBit(int n) {
        int position = 0;
        while (!(n & (1 << position))) {
            position++;
        }
        return position;
    }
    ```

    - To find the position of the first unset bit (0), you can use a similar approach by inverting the bits of the number.

14. **Bit Reversal**:
    Bit reversal involves reversing the order of bits in an integer. This can be useful in various applications like image processing or cryptography.

    ```c
    unsigned int reverseBits(unsigned int n) {
        unsigned int reversed = 0;
        int numBits = sizeof(n) * 8;
        for (int i = 0; i < numBits; i++) {
            if (n & (1 << i)) {
                reversed |= (1 << (numBits - 1 - i));
            }
        }
        return reversed;
    }
    ```

15. **Bit-Level Operations on Floats**:
    Bit manipulation can also be applied to floating-point numbers to examine and modify their components (sign, exponent, mantissa) at the bit level. This is often used in systems programming or when working with IEEE 754 floating-point representations.

16. **Sparse Bit Sets**:
    In some cases, you may need to work with sparse sets of bits, where only a few bits out of a large set are set. Data structures like bitsets or bitboards are used to efficiently represent and manipulate such sets.

17. **Using Bitwise Operators for Optimization**:
    Bit manipulation can sometimes lead to optimized code when compared to arithmetic operations, especially on low-level hardware. Techniques like bit masking and bit shifts can be used to improve the performance of certain algorithms.

18. **Bit Manipulation in Graphics and Game Development**:
    Bit manipulation is commonly used in graphics programming and game development for operations like pixel manipulation, collision detection, and rendering optimization.

19. **Bitwise Operations in Data Compression**:
    Many compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and Run-Length Encoding (RLE), rely on bit manipulation to efficiently represent and encode data.

20. **Bitwise Operations in Cryptography**:
    Cryptographic algorithms often involve complex bit manipulation to ensure data security, random number generation, and encryption/decryption processes.

These advanced bit manipulation techniques can be applied in a wide range of fields, including system programming, embedded systems, cryptography, data compression, and graphics programming, to optimize code, manipulate data at a granular level, and achieve specific algorithmic goals.
